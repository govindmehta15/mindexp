# MindExp Application: Development Process

This document outlines the development steps and iterative process followed to build the MindExp application.

## Phase 1: Core Page Implementation & Initial UI

### 1. Homepage (`/`)

The initial focus was on creating a comprehensive and engaging homepage to serve as the main entry point for users.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Section Layout:** The page was structured with multiple sections to introduce users to MindExp's core offerings:
  - **Hero Section:** A welcoming banner with a clear value proposition and primary calls-to-action (CTAs).
  - **Mission & Vision:** Cards explaining the "Why" behind MindExp.
  - **Ecosystem Features:** An overview of the main platform pillars (Community, Assessments, Research, Content).
  - **Testimonials:** A carousel to display social proof and user stories.
  - **Research Highlights:** A section to feature ongoing research projects.
  - **Content Highlights:** Previews of articles, videos, and podcasts.
  - **Mini Self-Assessment:** An interactive element for a quick mood check-in.
- **Component-Based Design:** Utilized ShadCN UI components like `Card`, `Button`, and `Carousel` for a consistent and modern look.

**Development & Bug Fixes:**
- The implementation of the homepage was an iterative process that involved resolving several critical build errors reported by Next.js.
- **`Parsing ecmascript source code failed`:** This recurring error was traced to multiple syntax issues, including missing semicolons at the end of array definitions and incorrectly placed conversational text within the component code. These were resolved over several attempts.
- **`ReferenceError: Badge is not defined`:** This error occurred because the `Badge` component was used in the JSX without being imported. The fix involved adding the correct import statement.

### 2. "About & Vision" Page (`/about`)

A dedicated page was created to elaborate on the mission, vision, and team behind MindExp, based on a detailed design specification.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Thematic Design:** Followed a specific theme with a gradient-based color flow and distinct typography (`Poppins` for headlines).
- **Structured Content Sections:**
  - The Problem We're Solving (The Student Support Gap)
  - Our Mission Statement
  - Vision for the Future (Timeline)
  - What Makes MindExp Different (Approach Cards)
  - The People Behind MindExp (Team Grid)
  - Global Research & Partnerships
  - Sustainability & Ethics
- **Animations:** Integrated `framer-motion` to create smooth fade-in and reveal animations for different sections, enhancing the user experience.

**Development & Bug Fixes:**
- **`"use client" metadata export error`:** A Next.js build error was encountered because `metadata` was being exported from a Client Component. This was resolved by removing the static `metadata` export from the file, aligning with Next.js App Router rules.

### 3. "Community" Page (`/community`)

A comprehensive landing page for the community section was built to serve as a central hub for user interaction.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Complete UI/UX Theme:** Implemented a new color palette (Deep Blue, Mint Green, Lavender) and typography (`Poppins`) specific to the community section.
- **Feature-Rich Sections:**
  - A hero section with clear CTAs for students and professionals.
  - "What Our Community Offers" feature cards.
  - A "Featured Circles" section to encourage users to join groups.
  - Placeholders for dynamic content like events, mentors, and testimonials.
  - A "Community Guidelines" section to emphasize safety and respect.
- **Static Implementation:** The page was built with static data to establish the full UI before connecting it to backend APIs.

### 4. "Research & Collaboration" Page (`/research`)

This page was designed to showcase MindExp's commitment to evidence-based practices and to invite collaboration.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Academic & Professional Theme:** Updated the theme to use a serif font (`Merriweather`) for headlines to convey credibility.
- **Information Architecture:** Structured the page to include:
  - Featured research projects with detailed summaries.
  - A gallery for different content types (PDFs, Videos, Infographics).
  - A "Call for Collaboration" section with a placeholder for a proposal form.
  - A section for partners and ethical commitments.
  - An FAQ section to address common questions from potential collaborators.
- **Data Management:** Created a dedicated `src/lib/research-data.ts` file to manage the static content for the page, keeping the component logic clean.

**Development & Bug Fixes:**
- Resolved another instance of the `"use client" metadata export error` by removing the `metadata` object from the page component.

### 5. "Content Hub" Feature (`/content`)

This feature was created to serve as a library of curated resources for students.

**Features Implemented:**
- **Content Hub Page (`/content`):** A main landing page that displays all available resources in a filterable grid layout.
  - Implemented filtering controls for content type and topic.
  - Designed `ContentCard` components to display previews for different media types (articles, videos, podcasts).
- **Dedicated Content Page (`/content/[id]`):** A detail page for viewing a single piece of content.
  - Includes a media viewer placeholder, description, tags, and action buttons.
- **Navigation Integration:** Added links to the new "Content" page in the main header and sidebar for easy access.

**Development & Bug Fixes:**
- **`params` access warning:** Addressed a Next.js console warning about directly accessing `params.id` in a Client Component. The code was updated to use the `useParams` hook, which is the recommended approach.

### 6. General UI/UX Enhancements

- **Navigation Update:** Added a "Home" link to both the main header (`AppHeader.tsx`) and the `AppSidebar.tsx` to improve site-wide navigation and user experience.
